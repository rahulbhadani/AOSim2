MATLAB-based Adaptive Optics simulation

Most of this code is the property of Johanan L. Codona, Ph.D.

I have included some code from the MathWorks web site to compute Zernike polynomials and Mark Milton's code to compute disk harmonics.  
I am trying to clean up this repo wrt licenses.  If in doubt, ask.  

See the license file for more details.
